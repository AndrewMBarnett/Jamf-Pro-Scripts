# Thycotic Privilege Manager macOS Agent
### Description

Queries the macOS Thycotic Management Agent for various settings, saves the results to the user's Desktop as an HTML file, which is then opened in Safari.

If the `testAgentConnection` function results in a failure, the `kickstartAgent` function executes `settmsserver -serverUri ${thycoticURL} -installCode ${agentInstallCode}` in an attempt to resolve the connection failure.
