# Your Internal Beta Test Program: Opt-in / Opt-out via Self Service
## Background

Inspired by @elliotjordan's plea to obtain user feedback, we've been using a pop-up menu Computer Extension Attribute called "Testing Level" which has three options:
- Alpha (i.e., bleeding-edge test machines)
- Beta (i.e., direct team members)
- Gamma (i.e., opt-in testers from various teams)
